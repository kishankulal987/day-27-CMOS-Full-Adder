# CMOS Full Adder in Verilog

## Overview

In this project, I implemented a full adder in Verilog using CMOS NAND gates to demonstrate transistor-level design. My goal was to create a circuit that computes the sum and carry-out for three input bits (`a`, `b`, `cin`), where:

- `sum = a XOR b XOR cin`
- `carry = ab + c(a XOR b)`

For example, with inputs `a=1`, `b=1`, `cin=0`, the output is `sum=0`, `carry=1` (1 + 1 + 0 = 2 in binary).

I designed a `cmosnand` module to model a CMOS NAND gate using PMOS and NMOS transistors, then used it to build the full adder. I wrote a testbench to verify the functionality by testing all possible input combinations and confirmed the design works as expected through simulation.

## Module: `cmosnand`

### What I Did
I designed a CMOS NAND gate using transistor-level modeling.

### Inputs
- `x`: First input  
- `y`: Second input  

### Outputs
- `f`: NAND output (`f = ~(x & y)`)

### How It Works
- Two PMOS transistors (`p1`, `p2`) in **parallel** connect `f` to `vdd` (`supply1`) when `x=0` or `y=0`.
- Two NMOS transistors (`n1`, `n2`) in **series** connect `f` to `gnd` (`supply0`) via an intermediate wire `a` when `x=1` and `y=1`.
- The configuration implements `f = ~(x & y)` as per CMOS NAND gate topology.

### Style
Transistor-level (switch-level) modeling using PMOS and NMOS primitives.

## Module: `fulladder_cmos`

### What I Did
I designed a full adder using CMOS NAND gates to compute the sum and carry-out.

### Inputs
- `a`: First input bit  
- `b`: Second input bit  
- `cin`: Carry-in bit  

### Outputs
- `sum`: Sum output (`a XOR b XOR cin`)  
- `cout`: Carry-out output (`ab + c(a XOR b)`)

### How It Works

#### XOR Logic for Sum
NAND gates `n1` to `n4` compute `t4 = a XOR b`:

- `t1 = ~(a & b)`  
- `t2 = ~(t1 & a)`  
- `t3 = ~(t1 & b)`  
- `t4 = ~(t2 & t3)`

NAND gates `n5` to `n8` compute `sum = t4 XOR cin`:

- `t5 = ~(t4 & cin)`  
- `t6 = ~(t5 & t4)`  
- `t7 = ~(t5 & cin)`  
- `sum = ~(t6 & t7)`

#### Carry Logic

- `cout = ab + c(a XOR b)`
- Implemented as `cout = ~(t1 & t5)`, where `t1 = ~(a & b)` and `t5 = ~(t4 & cin)`

Intermediate wires `t1` to `t7` connect the NAND gates to form the logic.

### Style
Structural modeling using `cmosnand` module instantiations.

## Testbench: `fulladder_cmos_tb`

### What I Did
I created a testbench to verify the CMOS full adderâ€™s functionality.

### How It Works
- Defined inputs `a`, `b`, `cin` and outputs `sum`, `cout`
- Used a `for` loop to iterate through all 8 possible input combinations (`{a, b, cin}` from `000` to `111`)
- Each test case runs for 10ns
- Simulation ends with `$finish` after testing all inputs

### Time Scale
Set to `1ns / 1ps` for precise simulation timing.

### Purpose
To ensure the full adder correctly computes the sum and carry-out for all input combinations.
